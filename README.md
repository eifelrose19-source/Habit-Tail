HabitTail
Turning habit-building into a gamified adventure for the next generation.


HabitTail is a sophisticated, family-centric behavioral framework engineered to cultivate discipline and agency in children ages 8–12. By synthesizing "Cyber-Pastel" design principles with "Pet Care" gamification, the platform reimagines routine household responsibilities as essential components of a thriving digital ecosystem.


Project Overview
Habit Tail is a cross-generational wellness application designed with a dual-interface philosophy. It provides parents with robust, data-driven oversight through a clean, intuitive management layer, while simultaneously utilizing age-appropriate gamification and vibrant visual feedback to foster consistency and agency in children.


Key Features (Currently Implemented)
Dual-Role Authentication: Distinct onboarding journeys for "Family Creators" (Parents) and "Joiners" (Partners/Children).


Parental Mission Control serves as the application's administrative security gate. It is a high-security, authenticated environment designed to provide parents with absolute oversight without compromising the child-friendly experience of the primary interface. By implementing a 4-digit PIN gateway, the app creates a clear barrier and functional boundary between the child's "Engagement Zone" and the parent's "Management Zone."


The Unique Family ID System acts as the architectural anchor for the household, enabling a synchronized ecosystem across multiple devices. By utilizing Invite Code Authentication, the app eliminates complex login hurdles, allowing parents to extend "Mission Control" access or "Child View" access to tablets and smartphones via a secure, one-time alphanumeric bridge


The Cyber-Pastel Design System is a bespoke visual language engineered to bridge the gap between high-tech utility and approachable softness. By prioritizing "Visual Evenness," the framework ensures that every screen feels like part of a singular, cohesive world, reducing visual clutter for parents while maintaining a high-engagement environment for children.


The Design Process
This project was built with a Product-First approach. Before a single pixel was placed in Figma, I spent 3 hours on paper documentation defining:


Padding & Spacing Scales: Ensuring a consistent 8pt grid system for professional "rhythm".


Security Logic: Mapping out the edge cases for "Partner" invites versus "Child" joins.


Demographic Specifics: Tailoring the UI for 8-12 year olds who have their own devices but still require parental oversight.


Technical Stack
Design: Figma (High-Fidelity Prototyping)


Framework: Flutter / Dart


Architecture: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) logic


Roadmap
[ ] Phase 2: The Pet Room (Interactive dashboards for kids)


[ ] Phase 3: The Proof Vault (Camera-based task verification)


[ ] Phase 4: The Reward Shop (In-app currency exchange for real-world rewards)
