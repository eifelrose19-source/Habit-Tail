HabitTail
Turning habit-building into a gamified adventure for the next generation.

HabitTail is a secure, family-centric habit-tracking application specifically architected for children ages 8–12. By blending "Cyber-Pastel" aesthetics with "Pet Care" mechanics, the app transforms daily chores into essential missions for a digital companion.

Project Overview
Most habit trackers are either too "babyish" or too "corporate." HabitTail hits the "tween" sweet spot—offering enough complexity to feel "grown-up" while maintaining the engagement of a mobile game.

Key Features (Currently Implemented)
Dual-Role Authentication: Distinct onboarding journeys for "Family Creators" (Parents) and "Joiners" (Kids/Partners).

Parental Mission Control: A secure admin layer protected by 4-digit PIN gating to manage family settings and rewards.

Unique Family ID System: Seamlessly connect multiple devices to a single household ecosystem using invite codes.

Cyber-Pastel Design System: A custom UI framework designed for high visual "Evenness" and consistency across 10+ frames.

The Design Process
This project was built with a Product-First approach. Before a single pixel was placed in Figma, I spent 3 hours on paper documentation defining:

Padding & Spacing Scales: Ensuring a consistent 8pt grid system for professional "rhythm".

Security Logic: Mapping out the edge cases for "Partner" invites versus "Child" joins.

Demographic Specifics: Tailoring the UI for 8-12 year olds who have their own devices but still require parental oversight.

Technical Stack
Design: Figma (High-Fidelity Prototyping)

Framework: Flutter / Dart

Architecture: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) logic

Roadmap
[ ] Phase 2: The Pet Room (Interactive dashboards for kids)

[ ] Phase 3: The Proof Vault (Camera-based task verification)

[ ] Phase 4: The Reward Shop (In-app currency exchange for real-world rewards)
